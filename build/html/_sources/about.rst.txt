The primary aim of PRAXIS is to determine the full astronomical potential of the technique of using fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) for atmospheric OH suppression in astronomy. To achieve this, we are now building, in a close collaboration with the University of Sydney and the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam, a dedicated high-throughput low-noise J and H-band spectrograph and associated fibre feed and telescope fore-optics unit. For atmospheric line filtering, the instrument will employ the GNOSIS FBG fibre bundle and a new multicore FBG bundle now being developed.
